This project marks the completion of my final task for The Summer Analytics program. I've truly enjoyed the journey â€” from exploring machine learning concepts to developing practical 
solutions.

The learning materials were clear, concise, and extremely effective in building my foundations. A huge thank you to the Consulting & Analytics Team for curating such a well-structured
and impactful learning experience. It's been a valuable step forward in my data and analytics journey.
